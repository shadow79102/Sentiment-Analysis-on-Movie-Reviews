# Sentiment analysis on nltk movie reviews data set achieving more than 93% accuracy

## Introduction
The main idea behind this project was to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed by a movie review. In this project, I explored different types of feature models like the Top-N feature model and the bag-of-words model and brought them together.
